In wet and dry laboratories, and with collaborators, we are gathering data from systematic perturbation experiments with rich observational readouts to derive quantitative and predictive models. We have a particular interest in identifying promising combination therapies for cancer to circumvent drug resistance.",

We collaborate closely with clinicians (primarily at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI) and Memorial Sloan Kettering) to apply bioinformatics analysis to cancer genomics. For example, by analyzing pan-cancer oncogenic signatures from around 10,000 patients, we are developing a tool to match patients to appropriate clinical trials based on shared occurrence of genomic alterations. We anticipate working with clinicians to design basket or match trials in the near future.",

Since our first attempts at residue contact prediction by the analysis of correlated mutations in protein families in 1994, we have solved the problem of 3D fold prediction using information from next-generation sequencing. We are now generating evolutionarily constrained sequences in the laboratory, and further developing a quantitative theory relating biopolymer sequences to phenotypic consequences.",

During his graduate work in cancer biology at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, he became fascinated by how \"normal\" cells in the tumor microenvironment influence cancer development, maintenance, and progression. To address limitations in existing methods for studying tumor-microenvironment interactions, he developed a proteomic method called CTAP for identifying and linking thousands of proteins to their cellular source in heterogeneous cell culture using mass spectrometry. During his postdoc, Nick developed a web resource for visualizing and analyzing recurrent mutation hotspots in protein domains in cancer (mutationaligner.org) and also spearheaded technology development for evolutionary constraint determination. At the cBio Center at DFCI, Nick is leading an experimental lab focused on method development for evolution-selection experiments and evaluating combination therapies for overcoming cancer drug resistance."

After his university studies in bioinformatics in Munich, he crossed the Atlantic just at the right time to work with Chris Sander and Debora Marks on the prediction of protein 3D structure using evolutionary couplings. Since then, Thomas has developed pioneering methods to predict the structure and function of transmembrane proteins, protein interactions, and the effects of mutations upon phenotype and fitness. He is also committed to making the evolutionary couplings approach readily available to the biology community through user-friendly tools, such as the EVcouplings webserver (www.evfold.org)."
