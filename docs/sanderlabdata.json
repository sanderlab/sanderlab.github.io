The overall goal of our work is to solve biological problems using quantitative methods from bioinformatics, machine learning, statistical physics, data science and mathematics. We apply these computational methods to build predictive network models of molecular and cell-cell interactions, to support cancer precision medicine and early detection of cancer, and to make discoveries in structural, evolutionary and cell biology.",

In wet and dry laboratories, and with collaborators, we are gathering data from systematic perturbation experiments with rich observational readouts to derive quantitative and predictive models. We have a particular interest in identifying promising combination therapies for cancer to circumvent drug resistance. A recent example is the combination of PARPi and FASNi in high grade serous ovarian cancer.",

We collaborate closely with clinicians (primarily at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI) and Memorial Sloan Kettering) to apply bioinformatics analysis to cancer genomics. For example, by analyzing pan-cancer oncogenic signatures from around 10,000 patients, we are developing a tool to match patients to appropriate clinical trials based on shared occurrence of genomic alterations. We anticipate working with clinicians to design basket or match trials in the near future.",

We seek active and mututally supportive collaborative opportunities within the local insitutions and increasingly world wide, especially during and after the 2019 oandemic.

In her graduate studies at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) and University of Zurich, she studied the Wnt signaling pathway using a combination of large-scale quantitative sequencing approaches and somatic genetics (e.g., CRISPR/Cas9). As a Research Fellow in Chris Sanderâ€™s group, Alexandra is interested in identifying cancer vulnerabilities that are exploitable for high efficacy cancer therapies. Alexandra spends time in both the wet and dry lab, applying perturbation biology and computational modeling to comprehensively profile and model the pathomechanisms involved in high-grade serous ovarian cancer."

He holds an Honor Bachelor Degree in Biology from Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU). He did a one-year research project with Dr. Tian Xu at Yale (now at Westlake University), where he completed his thesis on unsupervised and supervised learning in cancer transcriptome. Previously he conducted research on stem cell biology, microbiome, cancer immunology and psychiatric disease. He has received multiple scholarship and awards. He has first-authored research articles and has given talks internationally on his work. As a graduate student in the Biological and Biomedical Sciences (BBS) program at Harvard Medical School, Bo is particularly interested in using deep learning to understand cell biology, especially on the single-cell level. He is co-advised by Aviv Regev at the Broad Institute."
